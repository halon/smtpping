.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a small tool that performs SMTP server delay, delay variation and
throughput measurements.
.Pp
It must be invoked with the
.Ar recipient
email address. Normally, the
.Ar server
should also be specified (prefixed with @); otherwise
.Nm
will try to find the recipient domain's
MX record, falling back on A/AAAA records.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds

.It Fl 6
Use IPv6.

Time in milliseconds to wait between pings (default: 1000).
.It Fl c Ar count

conjunction with the
